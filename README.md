## Airbnb
This project is a feature-rich clone of Airbnb, designed for a seamless user experience. It allows users to browse accommodations. Users can sign up to become hosts, create and manage their own property listings, and upload property images. The platform includes essential features like favoriting properties and viewing personal bookings. A secure and robust payment system, powered by Stripe, ensures all transactions and reservations are handled safely.

- Implemented a secure payment gateway using Stripe Checkout to handle listing reservations.
- Added a webhook handler to automatically confirm bookings upon successful payment.
